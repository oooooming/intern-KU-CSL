Modeling Out-of-Order Execution Core
=====================================
CSE561 Advanced Computer Architecture @ Ajou University (Spring 2021)

This is the first project for CSE561. You should follow a given handout in details.
If you have questions regarding to the project, you may send an email to the TAs
or you could use the Q&A board on AjouBB.

Scope
=====
```
# how to compile
$ pwd
/home/user/project1/scopetool

$ make

# how to use
$ scope <input> <output>
```


Validation
==========
Students should check individual's app whether it properly works (e.g.
pipeline properly works on each cycle or each instruction processed in
the right order). For validation, students need to use the provided
trace files under `trace` directory. A sample file is a part of each
`real` trace file (e.g. `val_trace_*`). The purpose of giving the sample
is to give some idea for how to design a project and how sample outputs
look like. Students should test their app with various input options so
that the app works in all cases.
